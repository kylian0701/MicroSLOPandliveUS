# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 19, 2026**

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

## What the Extension Does

This extension performs local text replacements on web pages you visit:

- "Microsoft" → "Microslop"
- "Satya Nadella" → "Slopya Nuttela"
- "Copilot" → "Slopilot"
- "Artificial intelligence" → "Actually Indians"

All replacements happen locally in your browser. No information about your browsing activity, the pages you visit, or the text on those pages is collected or sent anywhere.

## Permissions

The extension requires broad host permissions (`*://*/*`) to perform text replacements on any website you visit. This permission is used solely for modifying page content locally.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be updated in this document.
